The quiz questions are stored in `Quiz/questions.json`. This separates the content from the HTML structure and JavaScript logic, making it easier to manage and update the questions.

The HTML (`pages/simulation.html`) provides the structure for the quiz interface, and the JavaScript (`Quiz/simulation.js`) fetches these questions from the JSON file to display them dynamically.
